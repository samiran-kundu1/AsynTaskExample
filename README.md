# AsynTaskExample
Example in wpf for an asynchronous application
In this example we have three buttons(one which executes asynchronously and one does not)
The count button on click increases the count 
We will obsersve that on clicking the button without async ,we cannot click on the count button
But, on clicking the the button with async,we can easily increment the counter
